# Dell-5310-Hackintosh

This is the first Dell Lattitude 5310 OpenCore EFI on version 0.9.5.

The EFI is working fine and is built for MacOS Ventura.

Current Issues:
1. USB storage devices not showing up despite creating the USBMap.kext
2. Upon boot, an error comes up that the OS crashed.
3. Trackpad gestures and multitouch is not working.
4. DRM will not work because it's no longer supported but running everything on Chrome works fine.

This is a work in progress and fixes/updates will be released when I get a chance to work on them.
